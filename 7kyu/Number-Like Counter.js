/* You're going to implement a simple counter class. The counter will start at zero, and every time 
its 'incr' method is called, it will increase by 1.
There's one caveat: Your counter must act like a number and support arithmetic operations and comparisons.
For example:
var c = new Counter();
c.incr(); // counter is now at 1
c + 1; // 2
c > 1; // false
c > 0; // true
c == 1; // true
Math.sqrt(c); // 1
You are not required to support equality comparison between two Counter instances.
*/

//Solution using a prototypes
function Counter() {
  this.number = 0
}
Counter.prototype.incr = function() {
  this.number++
}
Counter.prototype.valueOf = function() {
  return this.number
}

//Solution using a class
class Counter {
  constructor() {
    this.number = 0
  }  
  incr() {
    this.number++
  }
  valueOf() {
    return this.number
  }  
}
