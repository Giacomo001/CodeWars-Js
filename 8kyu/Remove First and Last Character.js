/* It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters 
of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less 
than two characters. */

//Simple solution with '.slice()' method
function removeChar(str){
 return str.slice(1, -1);
};

//Solution with '.substring()' method
function removeChar(str){
 return str.substring(1, str.length-1);
};

//The difference between the two is that 'substring' takes all the characters between the two set in the parenthesis.
